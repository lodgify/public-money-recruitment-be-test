After implementing, update rental and introducing PreparationTimeInDays field, I added followings to project:

- Data Layer: I used EntityFramework as ORM and Postgresql as database with code first approach. I moved the existing logic/models without updating them to EF.
- Repository Layer: introduced BaseRepository and common functions to all entities.
- Service Layer: I used simple CRUD operations from BaseService and introduced some new functionalities if needed.
- Moved the business logic to service layer from controller.
- AutoMapper: To convert entities to view model (reverse too) and binding models to view models.
- Unit tests: I implemented two sample tests to use mocks (Fakeiteasy) and updated existing unit tests with PreparationTimeInDays field.

Note: Since I moved the data to database instead of in memory usage, unit tests should be updated to be used by mocking the data layer but I didn't change that part.
Note2: I implemented all of the functionalities in a different feature branch and merged them into dev branch. At the end, I created a single pull request to master branch.
